## Prerequisites
To run the experiment notebooks, our representation-itl library needs to be installed. Please see https://github.com/uk-cliplab/representation-itl for instructions on how to install it.

## Imbalanced data representation
In 'imbalanced_datasets_experiments.ipynb' you will find the experiments conducted in the paper "The Representation Jensen-Renyí divergence" for imbalanced data classification. We assessed the JRD subsampling on 44 imbalanced, two-class datasets from the “Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning” (KEEL) repository.
